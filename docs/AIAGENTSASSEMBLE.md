Judging Criteria
Your projects will be evaluated based on these six key dimensions

Potential Impact
Evaluates how effectively the project addresses a meaningful problem or unlocks a valuable real-world use case.

Creativity & Originality
Assesses the uniqueness of the idea, novelty in approach, and how creatively sponsor technologies (Cline, Vercel, Kestra, Oumi, CodeRabbit) are applied.

Technical Implementation
Reviews how well the project was executed technically, whether it functions as intended, and the quality of integration with required sponsor technologies.

Learning & Growth
Recognizes the progress made during the hackathon, especially for first-time builders or teams pushing themselves with new tools or concepts.

Aesthetics & User Experience
Considers how intuitive, user-friendly, and polished the final project is, particularly if it has a frontend or user interaction layer.

Presentation & Communication
Evaluates the clarity of the README, the quality of the demo video, and how effectively the team communicates their idea and results.

Shield
Pro Tip
Focus on creating a project that not only works well technically but also solves a real problem and provides a great user experience. The best projects often excel in multiple criteria! Assemble your skills and tools to maximize your impact.

Eligibility and Participation
Age Requirement
Participants must be 16 years of age or older.

Registration
Only individuals who complete the official registration form will be granted access to the hackathon platform.

Online Participation
The hackathon is fully online. All team activities, including collaboration, workshops, mentoring, and project submissions, must take place using the designated platforms.

Team Composition
Teams may consist of 1 to 4 members. All members must be officially registered. Collaboration outside official channels is allowed only for coordination among registered teammates.

Project Rules
Use of Sponsor Technology
To qualify for cash prizes or interview opportunities, projects must follow the requirements for each prize category. Each award is tied to specific sponsor tools, and your submission must meet those requirements to be eligible.

The Infinity Build Award – $5,000
Your project must use Cline CLI. Cline must be used to build capabilities on top of the CLI that improve the software development experience, and your project should demonstrate complete, working automation tools built through the CLI.
The Wakanda Data Award – $4,000
Your project must use Kestra's built-in AI Agent to summarise data from other systems, with bonus credit if your agent can make decisions based on the summarised data.
The Iron Intelligence Award – $3,000
Your project must use the Oumi open-source library and must include Oumi's Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning features as part of your submission. Data Synthesis and LLM-as-a-Judge are optional but encouraged.
The Stormbreaker Deployment Award – $2,000
Your project must be deployed on Vercel, and the deployment must be live. Any standard Vercel deployment qualifies.
The Captain Code Award – $1,000
Your repository must demonstrate the use of CodeRabbit for PR reviews, code quality improvements, documentation, and open-source best practices. CodeRabbit activity should be clearly visible.
Projects that do not use the required sponsor technologies for their respective categories are not eligible for those sponsor-specific prizes.
